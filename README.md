## Introduction

This is a simple app for improving your memory.

It loads random images from the Internet. You click on the card to flip it over to see the image. If you flip two images that match, you can't turn it again. If they don't match, both images will be flipped back.

We used simple HTML, CSS and ReactJS.

You can load 3 or 5 or 7 images. You can also restart the game whenever you like.
